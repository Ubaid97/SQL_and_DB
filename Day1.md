# Day 1

## Database
- A database is a structured piece of data
- We must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of 
information, so that we can query it

### Terminology
- Column - correspond to the attributes of the object
- Row - 
- Table
- DBMS (Database Management System)

### Relational databses
- connected data

### Types of DBs
- Flat-file database
	- Stores everything in one table. Good for small numbers of 
records related to a single topic
- Relational Database
	- Gives you the ability
- Big Data

### Relationship types
- One to one
	- eg One person only has one NI number
- One to many
	- eg One author can have written man books
- Many to many
	- One user can write many ebooks
	- an ebook belongs to one user
	- Users can check out many books
	- Books can be checked out many times

### Primary key
- Uniquely identifies each record in the table
- Tables should have a primary key
- the primary can consist of more than one column - called a composite 
key
- Can either be an attribute guaranteed to be unique, or it can be 
generated by the BDMS
- the DBMS will enforce the uniqueness of the primary key, not allowing 
repeated records to exist in the table
- a primary key must be unique
- must have an entry - cannot be null
- its value must never change
- Each table may have a maximum of one primary key
- Two types:
	- simple - one column
	- composite - more than one column

### Foreign key
- A primary key that exists in a seperate table
- links a foreign table to the primary table

## Database tools
- Microsoft Access
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server
- SQLite
- MySQL

### Structured Query Language
- DML - Data Manipulation Language
- DDL - Data Definition Language
- DCL - Data Control Language
- TCL - Transaction Control Languages

## SQL Syntax 
- Create
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column_name data_type(x)
)
